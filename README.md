### OneStageDet

This project is my masterarbeit which aims at doing object detection with limited computational resources.
For this propose, my tutor suggests me to select yolov3. This one-stage model that is quick enough to allow us
adding more interesting tricks into, e.g. 

changes backbone, 
add Deformable convolutional networks, 
add SPP networks,
channel pruning etc.
Most of code are inspired by TencentYoutuResearch

THis project contains a lot of stupid script for handleing with raw data.
