### OneStageDet

This project is my masterarbeit which aims at doing object detection with limited computational resources.
For this propose, my tutor suggests me to select yolov3. This one-stage model that is quick enough to allow us
adding more interesting tricks into, e.g. changes backbone, Deformable convolutional networks, SPP networks, pruning etc.

and my basical code is inspired by my tutor Daniel and TencentYoutuResearch, thanks them all.
